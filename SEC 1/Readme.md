> lets Talk about package.json this file Contains the dependencies and the scripts for the Project

> manifest.json in the Public folder is connected with progressive web app which is out of scope our discussion

> index.html is the only Html File in your application , the most important part in the file is the root div

> in the index.js we see :

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

this means that App Component will render in the root div
