## what is React ?

## [Link of React Doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

> React : `is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces `.

> React : `is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called (components) `.

> React : `is a JavaScript library it is not a framework it is library it is focused on doing one thing and doing that one thing really well and that is the second part building user interfaces so`

> The user interface (UI) : `is the point at which human users interact with a computer, website or application. The goal of effective UI is to make the user's experience easy , requiring minimum effort on the user's part to receive maximum desired outcome `.

> `React does not focus on the other aspects of your application like routing or HTTP requests it is responsible only for building rich user interfaces`

> `react is a project created and maintained by Facebook when a company like Facebook uses to react in its own products and invests money and resources to keep the project alive you can be rest assured it is not going to die down anytime soon as of this recording it more than a hundred thousand stars on github and a huge community behind it this means to say you will be able to find tons of articles and Stack Overflow solutions to most of the problems that you will encounter when getting started with react also if you read through Stack Overflow developer survey every year you will quickly find out that react has become increasingly popular among developers and is also one of the most sought out skill sets by companies right now learn react and you have a great chance of landing that front-end developer job you've always wanted now`
